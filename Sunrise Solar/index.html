		<p>
			Solar panels are an investment not only in your home, but in the environment.
			<br>
			Your return on Investment can be earned back in as little as 10 years and you can
			even earn up to a 30% credit for your federal taxes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our climate is very compatible for Solar power generation.
			Solar Panels Actually Produce More Electricity in Cold Temperatures. 
			Homeowners with solar in snow states actually benefit from their panels' increased productivity. 
			As temperature decreases, the efficiency of the modules actually increases because the material properties
			in the panels operate more effectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Science tells us that the fossil fuels that are used to run our homes are constantly releasing toxins into the
			atmosphere and are a continuing contributor to respiratory diseases and global climate change.
			<br>
			You can help to reduce your carbon footprint and increase the resale value of your home by installing solar panels.
		</p>
		We offer several options with roof panels, ground panels or solar shingles.
		<br>

			Help yourself save and at the same time help save some of the most vulnerable animals on our planet.
