		Dear Peter & Bobby,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Your solar panel roof installation was such a pleasant experience we wish he had another house for you to work on! 
		You took the time to do the job right and not just make it work, but make it look good. <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; We have been saving about $90 a month and have been putting that extra savings towards a cruise in the Caribbean!
		Thank you so much for doing the job right.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mom & Dad

		Dear Pete,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; You and your team were great to work with!  Our backyard solar panel gets great sun exposure in the location you placed it
		and your suggestion to raise the panel to make lawn mowing easier has been extremely helpful!<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;We were able to qualify for the full 30% tax credit and our neighbors are often asking about our costs and savings.  We can’t
		say enough great things about our experience and we’ve been giving your name out to everyone that asks.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep up the great work!<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fred and Wilma Flint

		Dear Bobby,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank You so much for going the extra mile with our solar shingle installation.  The unexpected attic configuration caused you
		to get pretty creative with the wiring.  Your crew was great with the clean up too - every little scrap and nail seemed to be picked up!<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been an instant conversation starter when people are walking past the house and has helped us to get
		to know some of our new neighbors.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sincerely,<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; George and Louise Jefferson
