		<h1>About our family</h1>
		<p>
			Sunrise Solar is a family owned business started by brothers Pete and Bobby Brady.  Pete installed solar panels on his home in 1995 with some help from little brother Bobby.  The following year Bobby installed solar panels on his own home with some help from big brother Pete.
		</p>
		<p>
			They both were impressed with the cost savings to their electric bills.  They decided it was such a great thing that in 1997 they installed panels for their parents Mike and Carol and also fulfilled a request from their sister Marcia.
		</p>
		<p>
			The requests from friends and family started to grow, so in 2000 the brothers incorporated as Sunrise Solar.  As business increased they were able to hire their first employee in 2002.
		</p>
		Since 2000 Sunrise Solar has installed solar panels for over 500 homes and has over 15 employees.  Their team is continuing to grow!<br>
